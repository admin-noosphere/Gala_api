# Audio Format Fix Summary

## Problem
The api_client_neurosync.py was receiving audio data from Gala on port 6969, but failing to process it with the error:
```
Loading as WAV failed: Error opening <_io.BytesIO object>: Format not recognised
```

This was happening because Gala sends raw PCM audio data without WAV headers, but the NeuroSync model expects proper WAV format.

## Solution
Created `api_fixed_audio.py` with the following improvements:

1. **PCM Detection and Conversion**
   - Automatically detects if incoming audio is raw PCM (doesn't start with "RIFF")
   - Converts PCM to WAV format by adding proper headers
   - Auto-detects appropriate sample rate based on data size

2. **WAV Header Creation**
   ```python
   def create_wav_from_pcm(pcm_data, sample_rate=16000):
       wav_buffer = io.BytesIO()
       with wave.open(wav_buffer, 'wb') as wav_file:
           wav_file.setnchannels(1)  # Mono
           wav_file.setsampwidth(2)  # 16-bit
           wav_file.setframerate(sample_rate)
           wav_file.writeframes(pcm_data)
       wav_buffer.seek(0)
       return wav_buffer.read()
   ```

3. **Smart Sample Rate Detection**
   - Defaults to 16kHz (Gala's standard format)
   - Adjusts to 48kHz for very short clips
   - Adjusts to 8kHz for very long clips

## Result
✓ API now correctly processes raw PCM audio from Gala
✓ Successfully converts audio to blendshapes
✓ Sends data to LiveLink for Unreal Engine
✓ No more format recognition errors

## Usage
```bash
# Start the fixed API
python api_fixed_audio.py

# Test with PCM data
python test_fixed_audio_api.py
```

## Status
- All tests passing
- Audio processing working correctly  
- Ready for integration with Gala's main pipeline
